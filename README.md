# Greg's Gecko Extensions README

This is a mono-repo for extensions I write for making working in Gecko and Firefox a more pleasant experience.

## Features

Currently, there is only one feature, enabled by default. This is a check to see if a file was opened in the object directory "obj-". It provides a warning. I have lost too much work from this.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Added the object directory warnings.
